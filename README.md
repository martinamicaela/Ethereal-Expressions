# Ethereal Expressions

This project is to develop a website for the artist Adamma Anwen Lloyd, with the goal of showcasing her work and attracting potential clients or buyers. We aim to include a gallery page with high-quality images of her work, an about the artist page and a contact form for enquiries or purchases. 

As far as the user is concerned, they should be able to view Adamma's work and contact her for any commissions or purchases. This should be covered within our intended site.

In terms of design, there should be a cohesive colour scheme and set of styles across the whole site to reiterate the artist's brand. Site layout should enhance rather than impede the user experience to give a welcoming, intuitive feel. Finally, the site layout should be responsive to enable easy navigation on all devices.

- **Gallery Page**

The gallery page contains eight four-piece collections from the artist, displayed in a grid using Bootstrap CSS. The user can click on any of the pieces to see it full-size, and an on-hover shadow effect highlights image as the mouse passes over them.

- **Contact Page**

The contact page is comprised of two parts. First, there is a contact form for users to get in touch with the artist. This give options to submit either a general enquiry, a purchase enquiry or to contact about a commission. 

The second part of the page deals with contact details for the artist giving a portrait photo, contact details and an embedded map showing her location.

This page was structured using bootstrap.

## Testing



### Responsive Testing

- Alongside the built in Bootstrap responsive CSS, media queries were used throughout our own CSS to provide a consistent user experience. Chrome dev tools were used frequently to test the site at standard screen sizes and the site was manually viewed on laptops, tablets and phones.
