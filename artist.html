 "When art belongs to the observer it becomes the most extraordinary 
form of catharsis"  (home page )
</p>

<p>From Paris to New York both, Adamma's art captivated critics, artists and public. Her figure has represneted a fresh breeze for the artistic sphere.
    Using the impasto technique with a delicious palette, Adamma managed to capture the beauty of the Welsh coast and Coutryside, the silky textures of 
    the Nigerian Gele and the vibrant and exquisite colours of Nigerian Iborum, Buba and Iro.

<h3>About Author</h3>
<p>
Adamma is a British Nigerian Authour, born in one of the  most artistic
cities in the whole of the UK : Cardiff. The Welsh capital city would be the starting point 
from where Adamma would complete her studies in Fine Art and would set up her first gallery  "Etherial Expressions". 
With the success of her first gallery Adamma dared to expand her art overseas and it was an absolute success. Part of her succes 
is linked to Adamma's lifetime experience. Since her childhood Adamma developed a very unique identity, as her family roots,
both Welsh and Nigerian allowed her to have a richer knowledge about  artistic style  and expression. In her first presentation in Paris  2015, 
Adamma aimed to create something that could represent not only modernity, 
abstraction and beauty, but also a glipmse of herself:"My art reflcts my heritage, my passion, my present and my future"
